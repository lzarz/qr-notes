## Reporting Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability or potential security issue, please open a public issue to report the problem. Ensure that you provide enough context to help the maintainers understand the concern. Avoid disclosing sensitive details that could be exploited.

## Secure Coding Practices

We encourage contributors to follow secure coding practices, including:

- Avoiding hardcoded sensitive information.
- Using encryption and proper hashing techniques.
- Validating and sanitizing all user inputs to prevent common attacks.
- Following the principle of least privilege for user roles and permissions.

By contributing to this project, you agree to adhere to the security and contribution guidelines.
